Based on the evidence the loss data provides, the primary suspects for scamming the Lucky Duck Casino are Mylie Schmidt and Billy Jones. 
Jones and Schmidt are the two consistent factors during the occurences of losses. Every time that money was lost Schmidt was playing and Jones was dealing. 
On 3/10, 3/12 and 3/15 substantial money was lost and the records show that both of these individuals were involved when the incident happened.
